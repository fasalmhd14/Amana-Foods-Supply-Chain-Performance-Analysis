**AMANA FOODS SUPPLY CHAIN PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS REPORT**


This is an **unguided Project**.

This Data Analysis project analyses the  **service levels** received by the customers of Amana Foods in order to improve them.

The Data analysis and Visualization was done using **Power BI**

The **key Metrics** used to track service levels are

*On-time delivery (OT) %
*In-full delivery (IF) %
*On Time in full (OTIF) %.
*Line Fill Rate (LIFR) %
*Volume Fill Rate (VFR)%

 
In supply chain it is very important to maintain high service levels to sustain the customer relationships.  Falling back in the services quality makes a company less reliable and leads to decreased customer satisfaction and lost sales
